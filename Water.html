<h3>Water is essential to life, and it is important to understand how it works.</h3>
<h4>Polarity</h4>

<p>Water is a polar molecule with intramolecular covalent bonding and intermolecular hydrogen bonding.</p>
<p>Covalent bonds between oxygen and hydrogen IN the water molecule.</p>
<p>- Hydrogen bonds between oxygen and hydrogen BETWEEN neighboring water molecules</p>
<h4>Universal Solvent</h4>
<p>Partial negative oxygen in water can bind with other, partially-positive molecules.</p>
<p>Partial positive hydrogen in water can bind with other, partially-negative molecules.</p>
<h4>Cohesion & Adhesion</h4>

<p>Cohesion - attraction of molecules of the same kind (Water attracted to water.)</p>
<p>Adhesion - attraction of molecules of a different kind (Water attracted to other polar molecules.)</p>
<h4>Surface Tension</h4>
<p>Cohesion develops a "surface" atop water bodies due to hydrogen bonding.</p>
<h4>Density</h4>
<p>Water is less dense as a solid since hydrogen bonds inhibit compaction, so ice floats in liquid water.</p>

<h4>High Specific Heat</h4>
<p>Water must absorb or release a LARGE amount of energy to change 1 gram of water by 1Â°C.</p>
<p>- Evaporative Cooling: release water on surface of organism to absorb heat energy from body (and break the bonds cooling down the organism)</p>
<p>- Temperature Buffer: coastal regions and body temperature does not change easily due to changes in temperature</p>
